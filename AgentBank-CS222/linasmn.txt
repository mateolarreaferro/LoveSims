[Part 1. Story of your life]
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)
Response:  
Earliest memory was seeing a coin and asking father to explain what coins do. The fact that we have one common thing to trade everything else seemed very smart. Subsequently related to interest in economics and political theory. 
 
Grew up in Lithuania. School became a priority only after 16, before that, just liked socializing and skateboarding. Introduced to philosophy at 16, and how exciting ideas can be. Read through books on philosophy of economics and political theory in high school. 
 
Studied a liberal arts dual degree, in Paris and New York: Paris Institute of Political Studies and Columbia. Main areas were economics and philosophy. 
 
Got a job at NYU afterwards to do economic research with one of the professors there, Paul Romer. During this time, realized that economics is not the field he wants to do for his PhD, and then spent the past 3 years retraining from scratch in computer science and cognitive science. Started with evening courses in computer science at NYU (had no prior CS experience), then a Masters at Oxford in statistics and machine learning, and then a year at Harvard doing research in computational cognitive science and AI. Then applied for a PhD at Stanford.

Very simple. Wake up at around 8am. Light breakfast, usually protein yogurt. Try to do all my administrative tasks in the morning starting at 9am, as he finds it harder to work in the mornings. Then go to the gym, followed by a light lunch. 
 
Starting in the afternoon, try to work as much as possible. Work till quite late until about 9.00pm. Come back and sometimes read fiction or watch Netflix shows. 
 
Run most nights right before going to bed at around 11pm to calm down. On the lookout for raccoons when running at night: coming from Northern Europe where no raccoons are found, thinks they are extremely cool and considers them his spirit animal.

Probably during a movie. Shed a tear during quite a few movies, including the new version of the film Top Gun, at the beauty of the technology behind the SR-71 fighter jet.
