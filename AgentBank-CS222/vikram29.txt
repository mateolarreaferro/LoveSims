[Part 1. Story of your life]
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)
Response:  
Growing up in Bombay with my parents, grandparents, and brother, I had a close-knit family environment. My early education took place at a highly disciplined school that deeply ingrained Hindu culture into its curriculum. This experience not only provided me with a strong academic foundation but also instilled in me a profound sense of discipline and cultural appreciation.
Music has been a significant part of my life from an early age. I began learning classical Indian music and piano, which cultivated my passion for the arts and provided a creative outlet alongside my academic pursuits.
A turning point came when I switched schools, a change that pushed me out of my comfort zone and compelled me to become more extroverted. Embracing this new environment, I became involved in the student council, school politics, and drama. These activities honed my leadership skills and enriched my high school experience.
Continuing my educational journey, I moved to Stanford University to study Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I joined Raag, Stanford's South Asian a cappella group. I’m still figuring out what I want to do after graduation.

Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)
Response:  
I have four main groups of friends. The first group consists of my high school friends; we've all relocated to the US for college and make it a point to reunite during holidays. We share a strong bond due to our similar backgrounds and the numerous experiences we've had together.
At college, I have three friend groups. The first is a group of international students from India, whom I met during my freshman year. We connected instantly due to our similar upbringings and the shared challenge of adapting to a new country. We spend a lot of our leisure and study time together.
The second group includes friends from my freshman year dorm. We became close because we were neighbors with similar interests, although our lives before college were quite different.
The third group is my acapella group, where our common passion for music brought us together and has kept us tightly knit.
