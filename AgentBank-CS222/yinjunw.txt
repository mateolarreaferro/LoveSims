[Part 1. Story of your life]  
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)  
Response:  
I was born and raised in a small town in northern China. Growing up in China, the education system placed immense pressure on students to succeed, and I had to study rigorously to gain admission to a good middle school and high school. As a result, I dedicated a significant amount of time to my studies during those formative years.
 
For college, I moved to Hong Kong, which was a pivotal change in my life. While studying there, I had the opportunity to visit UC Berkeley in the United States, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. That visit made a lasting impression on me, and it ultimately influenced my decision to come to the U.S. for my PhD.
 
I was born in Qingdao, a coastal city that’s famous for its beer—arguably the best in Asia. Growing up there, I drank quite a bit of it, as it’s part of the local culture.
 
In China, exams are very high-stakes; we often only have one chance to succeed on major tests. I excelled in math and science but found myself struggling a bit more with subjects like art and history.
 
Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). My research interests lie in operations research, where I use mathematical models to help companies make optimal decisions based on large datasets. I am also intrigued by computational social science, which involves using machine learning and AI to understand and predict human behaviors. I believe AI can simulate human actions in precise ways, which has vast potential for both science and industry. In college, I majored in pure mathematics and specialized in partial differential equations (PDEs) and optimization during my undergraduate years in China.

[Part 2. School life]  
What is your major, and what do you study? (2 minutes)  
Response:  
I am an MSE major, focusing on computational social science and operations research. Currently, I am enrolled in courses such as CS 222 (Applied Machine Learning), Applied Statistics (STATS 305a), and Data Science of Disinformation (DS 193). During the first two years of my PhD program, I am required to take courses, and in the future, I plan to take CS 329a, CS 224n, and Mining Massive Data Sets. These courses will provide a solid foundation for my research.
 
Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)  
Response:  
I have five close friends at Stanford, all of whom I met here during my time at the university. They are incredibly important to me because they are not only brilliant but also genuine, sincere, and trustworthy. I know I can rely on them for support and companionship when I need it.
 
What is your daily life like? (4 minutes)  
Response:  
I usually don’t have morning classes, so I wake up around 8 or 9 a.m. I spend most of my day in the cubicles at the Huang Engineering Center doing research. I typically have lunch and dinner with friends, which provides a good break from work. My classes are usually scheduled in the middle of the day. After finishing classes, I return to my dorm to continue working on research. I also make time for exercise before dinner, and on weekends, I like to relax by going out to the bar with friends.

[Part 3. Rapid-fire round]  
When was the last time you cried, and why? (2 minutes)  
Response:  
The last time I cried was right before my college admission exam. I had just taken a practice exam and scored poorly, which caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety.
 
What qualities do you value most in other people? (2 minutes)  
Response:  
I value honesty and authenticity the most in others. People who are real and sincere mean a lot to me.
 
Where have you lived? (2 minutes)  
Response:  
I have lived in Qingdao, Hong Kong, Berkeley, and now Stanford.
 
What would you do if you didn’t have to work? (2 minutes)  
Response:  
If I didn’t have to work, I would probably spend more time at the bar, enjoying life with friends.

[Part 4. Personal values and closing]  
What are your life values? (4 minutes)  
Response:  
My core life value is the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge for personal growth. Curiosity is at the heart of everything I do, and I strive to embody that in all my actions. It drives me to keep learning and improving, both as an academic and as a person.
