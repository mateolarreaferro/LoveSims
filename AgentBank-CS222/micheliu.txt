Born Whittier near Los Angeles
Parents: Earlier Chinese immigrants to US
Dad worked in Tech, Mom did accounting
Moved to SF when 2-3
Earliest memories, mom had her younger brother and went back to China first, considering moving back to China as a family
In condo house, trying to find mom, couldn’t understand where they went
Went to Beijing from 3-8 lived with grandparents, parents were busy
Dad working on business, mom was helping
Had very scheduled life, would go to bookstore certain times of day to read
Started primary school around 8, purely Chinese public school in system, prepare students for Gaocao exam, all classes, no extracurriculars
Moved back to parent’s place in elementary school (8)
In fifth grade transferred to different school, instead of focus on Chinese school system, more American based
Preparing to go abroad instead of exam, liked new school was a lot better
Started piano/clarinet
After graduated, moved back to US, lived in Irvine for middle school, transition wasn’t that hard since school in China helped prepare
Went to regular school, big Asian population, wasn’t that hard
Northwood High school, very competitive
High school more on autopilot, good grades/scores but wasn’t very focused on college
UCSB for undergrad (Economics)
College also on “autopilot” didnt really know what to do
Cared about volunteer work, animal shelter work, S503 public orgs (nonprofit) → org became more successful teaching English remotely to rural Chinese areas
Realized interested in education, but was close to graduation and didn’t want career in education
Friends were doing Tech working at big tech, became interested in programming, starting Junior summer, took first CS class at UCSB, started doing projects and work with friends at startups, started as intern then implemented features, graduated then applied to tech. Applied to CS program for graduate school. Education Data Science at Stanford, saw Ad on Instagram.
Thought nice combination of education and tech and got in, super senior graduated December 2022
Came to Stanford, took a lot of classes, famous CS classes, took NLP classes 
Last fall, started applying internships, wanted to do something AI focused, ended up going to Adobe, worked on building computer vision 3D pipeline for importing/editing/rendering 3D objects on platform
Really liked the job and thinks that after graduating, wants to start a position in tech doing what she was doing at Adobe
