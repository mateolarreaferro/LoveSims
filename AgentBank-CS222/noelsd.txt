[Part 1. Story of your life]
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)
Response:  I was born in Santa Clara, Cuba, in a small town where I stayed with my grandparents in a cozy two-story house that had a mango tree in the backyard. I lived there until I was five. Then, my family moved to a countryside home where my great-grandparents once lived. The place was filled with guava and mango trees, and I spent countless afternoons playing hide-and-seek with my friends after school. My school was right in the heart of town and focused on sports. I loved swimming, and I’d either ride my dad’s bike or hop on horse-drawn carriages that could fit about eight people to get there. My routine was pretty much get up early, train at 6 AM, head back at 8 PM, do my homework, and repeat that cycle for years.

I remember getting my first gaming console when I was around six or eight, which kept me entertained. Eventually, I moved back to the town center and stopped swimming by seventh grade, but I did dabble in triathlons the following year. Honestly, adjusting to city life was a bit of a challenge for me since I really loved the countryside. During this time, I turned more to video games, drawing, and reading. I wasn’t a heavy studier but still did well on exams. I graduated from elementary school with good grades.
When I hit ninth grade, my family moved to Tampa, Florida. My dad had come over earlier and managed to secure political asylum, so we made the leap to the U.S. I completed high school there, diving back into swimming and teaching myself subjects like English through video games and tons of reading. I took a bunch of advanced classes and discovered what college was about in eleventh grade. I applied to Stanford through QuestBridge, aiming for something in tech.
At Stanford, I met tons of amazing people, and my perspective on life shifted dramatically. Coming from a small country and small high school to a place filled with so many incredible individuals really made me rethink where I fit in the world. I chose to study computer science because it seemed challenging and exciting, but I struggled a lot during my first years. The assignments were way tougher than anything I’d dealt with before, and I lost some confidence.
When COVID hit, I moved in with friends for a bit and worked from home, which made it hard to stay motivated. But once I returned to campus, I found my groove again. I landed internships at Electronic Arts and Microsoft. I applied for the coterminal master’s program because I was still figuring out whether I wanted to dive back into industry work or keep learning. I didn’t get in on my first try, so I spent my summer working on a passion project focused on creating computer systems for managing resources in Cuba and other developing countries.
I returned for another quarter, thinking that if I tried for the coterm and spent more time learning, it would be a great opportunity. I got in and decided to specialize in computer security, as I was really intrigued by that field. Initially, I considered AI but thought it leaned too heavily on math rather than computer science. During my coterm, I built a solid community and embraced new hobbies, like motorcycle riding. I started with off-roading in Florida, bought my first bike, and then got another one when I moved to Seattle since I was feeling a bit bored.
Now, I’m more involved in the local motorcycle community and enjoy riding in the mountains with a bunch of cool engineers and friends I’ve made. I also got more social at the gym, working out daily after swimming because I love staying active. I’ve connected with an awesome group of people, ranging from doctors to med students and fluid dynamics professors. Their passion for their work and health has really inspired me in many ways.
I’m currently in my second year of the coterminal program and still exploring options for startups or smaller projects with other grad students here. That’s the scoop so far!


[Part 2. School life]
What is your major, and what do you study? (2 minutes)
Response:  Undergrad in Computer Systems, and for my co-term, I'm focusing on Computer Network Security.
 
Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)
Response:  
I spend a lot of time working out with professors, med students, and PhD candidates. We see each other almost every day, and it’s super inspiring to lift each other up.
They really get me and are genuinely passionate, motivating, and reliable. You know what to expect from them, which makes it easy to trust them.
In the past, I had a lot of friends from undergrad, but these days, it’s tough to keep in touch with everyone. We’re all on different schedules and have busy lives, so we only catch up every few months.
Some of my friends travel a lot, which makes staying connected even trickier.
 
What is your daily life like? (4 minutes)
Response:  
I usually wake up a bit late since I hit the hay pretty late after working. After I roll out of bed, I grab some breakfast and jump into coding on my four assignments. Lunch is usually a quick snack, and then I head to class, which kicks off around 11:30 or sometimes 1 PM. Throughout the day, I’m texting my friends and my girlfriend. Once classes wrap up, I head home for a snack to fuel my workout. I hit the gym sometime between 5 and 7 PM, but if I’m swamped with work, I might end up going around 9 or even as late as 10:30 (like I did yesterday). After the gym, it’s shower time, dinner, and some chill time with my girlfriend. I often dive back into work after that, usually wrapping up around 1 AM on a good night, or 2-3 AM on a really busy one.
Weekends are pretty similar, just without classes. Sometimes, I’ll head to the mountains for a motorcycle ride with friends, which can last anywhere from 2 to 5 hours. We might do some photoshoots or just hang out at a restaurant called Alice's, where I sometimes sell sandwiches. But that all depends on how much work I have. If I can’t make it out, I just stay home and work. I do hit up some of my friends' events or house parties now and then, but it’s mostly just casual hangouts, not a regular thing for me.

[Part 3. Rapid-fire round]
When was the last time you cried, and why? (2 minutes)
Response:  I think the last time I shed a tear was when a family member was recently diagnosed with cancer, and honestly, that hit me really hard. It stands out in my mind as the last time I truly broke down. Sure, I sometimes get emotional during movies or plays, but this situation was different. I vividly remember grappling with that diagnosis while feeling helpless because I couldn't be there in person to support them. While my family was by their side, I found myself calling them all the time just to show I cared and to offer my support. It was tough to stay present when all of that was going on
 
What qualities do you value most in other people? (2 minutes)
Honestly, the top qualities I appreciate in others start with honesty and reliability. Being consistent with your words and actions is a huge respect factor for me. Next up is ambition—I'm drawn to those who aren't afraid to set tough goals and chase them down, even when the going gets tough. Then there's kindness. I admire people who, despite their own busy lives and goals, still find time to think about others and offer their help where it’s needed. It’s a rare and valuable trait. Lastly, I really appreciate a spirit of adventure—those who embrace wild ideas, dive into new experiences, and take risks that make life more thrilling and interesting.

Where have you lived? (2 minutes)

Santa Clara, Cuba
Tampa, Florida
Stanford, Los Gatos
Redmond, Washington
Menlo Park


What would you do if you didn’t have to work? (2 minutes)
Response:  
if work wasn't a thing, I'd dive into building projects—like pulling GitHub repositories to tinker with drones or other cool tech, like embedded systems and motorcycles. I’d spend loads of time riding, getting better at it, and hitting the motocross tracks. I’m a fan of cross-country trips, so I’d definitely be doing more of those, plus exploring national parks. Of course, I’d make time for family and friends, hit the gym a lot, and really dive into cooking. Just the thought of focusing on those passions sounds like a dream!
