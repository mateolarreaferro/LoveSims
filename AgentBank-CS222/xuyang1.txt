[Part 1. Story of your life]
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)
Response: 
I think my earliest memory is when I was like, floating in some sort of river or water. I think that was in my mother's womb. But I feel like I also imagined it. So, I think the more realistic first piece of memory is when I was crawling on the ground with a little bucket on my head. I was taking a nap at some point, and as a baby, I just fell off the bed, crawled around, and the bucket fell off my head. It was really dangerous, and I was really scared. But then someone came to pick me up and got the bucket off me. 
 
As I grew up, I was traveling a lot. I spent most of my childhood in Suzhou, China, and I occasionally went to my grandparents' house to stay over the summer or during breaks whenever my parents had free time. Both of my grandparents lived close to Suzhou in a rural area. I also went to the countryside often to play with the kids. We ran around in the fields, biked, and did a lot of really fun things.
 
When I got to primary school, I think the most important memory was when I did an exchange program in Canada for three months. I went to Nova Scotia, near a city called Halifax, and lived with a host family. I had three host siblings, and we lived in the forest. We played and hung out in the forest, and we had three dogs and a cat. It was really fun and so different from what I was used to in China. I really didn’t want to come back. I think that was the beginning of my desire to study abroad in different environments.
 
In middle school, I actually chose to join a program that was different from the normal public school system in China. I took an entrance exam and was admitted to that program. It was a very small program with only about 27 students in my class. We had a lot of lectures and visiting speakers from universities, so we got to listen to talks from university professors while I was in middle school.
 
For high school, I went to United World College, first at the Suzhou campus, and then I was able to transfer to the Maastricht campus in the Netherlands. It was really fun and memorable. But then COVID happened. During high school, I was living with people from so many different countries and backgrounds. We had the opportunity to share our pasts and communicate about our cultures and thoughts. I had a really close friend group, and we even started a philosophy club together. We talked a lot about the differences between East Asian philosophy and Western philosophy. We did a lot of research and presentations one by one. I had a crush that turned out to be gay, which was unfortunate, but I still really like him. I haven’t really contacted him since graduation. He was a cute guy, but I'm not going to spell out where he’s from!
 
Then I got admitted to Stanford. It was my first time in the U.S., and when I came to Stanford for college, it was pretty different from what I expected. There were way more Asians than I thought there would be, and I was a little unused to the academic rigor at first, but I think I was able to catch up. I really appreciate my international background, so it wasn’t too difficult for me to adjust to the new environment. 
 
I got involved in a lot of Japan-related clubs at Stanford. I’m still involved; I was part of the Stanford Japan Exchange Conference for three years—this is my fourth year now. I was co-president of that club last year, and I co-founded the Japanese Tea Gathering Club, because we don’t like the word “ceremony.” I also went to study abroad in Kyoto for a quarter and did a short study abroad program in Florence, Italy when I was a freshman. My current major is Symbolic Systems, which is a really unique major at Stanford. So, yeah, that’s it!

[Part 2. School life]
What is your major, and what do you study? (2 minutes)
Response:  
 
My major is Symbolic Systems. It's a really interesting and unique major at Stanford that combines computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology. Everyone can choose different concentrations, and my concentration is Human-Computer Interaction. It focuses a lot on the design side—like, how do we create tech interfaces or technology that helps people solve the problems they’re facing? It’s very user-oriented.
 
I also have a lot of interests, which is why I ended up in Symbolic Systems rather than just pure computer science. I feel like I have more interest in the broader aspects of technology. I’m minoring in East Asian Studies, and I’ve been studying Japanese for three years now. Actually, this is my fourth year. I did one year focused on just oral communication, so I’m currently in my third-year Japanese class at Stanford.
 
I really love East Asian culture, literature, and religion, and that’s a big hobby of mine. So, I learn about it on the side!
 
 
Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)
Response:  
 
Here’s your revised script with the grammar corrected:
 
So, I can list a few friends. Currently, the friend I talk to the most is named Helen, and she’s really important to me because she’s always so inspiring. We have a similar value system; we both have some questions about the Bay Area’s tech-focused culture. Sometimes we think, okay, maybe we can’t solve all the problems with technology, and we need to approach things differently. It’s more of an idealistic mindset.
 
Helen is also very artsy. She writes great literature and reads a lot, while being good at everything else. She’s currently majoring in International Relations, but she just switched from Electrical Engineering this year. She was in that major for the past three or four years and was almost done with it. So, she’s really skilled in both technical and non-technical areas. I really appreciate people who excel in different disciplines at the same time.
 
I should mention a few more friends since you asked about them! Another good friend of mine is Sera. She majors in Comparative Literature and is one of those people who says, “I would never do CS.” She really loves drawing and is great at it, creating a lot of cute original characters. We co-founded Stanford’s Sadō Clubs together, and she has great leadership skills. We both love East Asian culture and even went to Japan together during a study abroad program.
 
I have a few other friends, like Rosina and Jennifer. Oh, and Sunny! Most of my friends are girls because I just enjoy female friendships. I also really love talking to Feiyang about philosophical topics. Most of my friends are in humanities and social science disciplines, and I think I just vibe more with people in those areas.

What is your daily life like? (4 minutes)
Response:  
 
For my daily life, I wake up every day at around 7 a.m., and I go jogging around campus every other day. I run about three to four miles, and then I stretch. After that, I take a shower and eat breakfast. If I have time, I do some Japanese studies in the morning before my Japanese class at 9:30 a.m.
 
After class, which lasts for an hour, I have morning classes at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays called Human-Centered AI. On days when I don’t have class, I usually study in one of the cafeterias on campus, either at Forbes Cafe or CoHo. Sometimes, when the weather is nice, I study outside, but if I want to concentrate more, I go to the library.
 
I have lunch around noon. In the afternoons on Mondays and Wednesdays, I have a class called Agents and Simulations. After that, I usually study in the library or go back to my room. I eat dinner between 5 and 6 p.m., either at Wilbur Dining or Casper Dining. After dinner, I normally just study if I don’t have club meetings or other commitments.
 
So, that’s pretty much my everyday routine! Oh, and I usually go to bed around 11 p.m.

[Part 3. Rapid-fire round]
When was the last time you cried, and why? (2 minutes)
Response:  
 
It’s a little hard to explain, but I was watching a documentary about a World War II ship that sank in China’s waters. The ship carried a lot of soldiers from the Allies, including many British soldiers. I was really moved by how much the director put into documenting that history.
 
I also watched two of his TED Talks—or, actually, the Chinese version called Yixi. I found it inspiring to hear his perspective on how to live your life. He emphasized that you should always do things you love and are passionate about, and that really resonated with me. 
 
This made me rethink my future and consider pivoting away from the typical path of becoming a software engineer. I started asking myself, "What else can I do with the skills I have, and what am I truly passionate about?" That reflection actually brought me to tears because I realized that I can pursue what I love without being limited by what society expects of me.

What qualities do you value most in other people? (2 minutes)
Response:  
 
There are a lot of things that I value, but it’s really hard to pinpoint what I value the most. I would say honesty is at the top of my list. I feel like people can have really different traits and understandings, and it’s completely normal to have different ways of thinking and approaching things. But I think it’s really important that we communicate about these differences. As long as we can express our thoughts truthfully, there’s a way for us to understand each other and still become friends.
 
However, if I’m with someone who always lies to me or refuses to share their true thoughts, it’s really difficult to get close to that person. It makes me feel a bit uneasy at times. I would much prefer someone to just tell me how they feel, especially if they disagree with me or if something urgent comes up in a teamwork setting. So, I really value honesty in people.

Where have you lived? (2 minutes)
Response:  
 
Here’s your revised script with the grammar corrected:
 
I’ve lived in a lot of places. I grew up in Suzhou, China, which is a city close to Shanghai with a rich history of over 2,500 years. I was really impacted by the traditional culture there. For high school, I went to the Netherlands, specifically to a city called Maastricht. It’s in southern Netherlands, close to Germany, Belgium, and France.
 
For university, I’m currently living at Stanford University in California, near Palo Alto. It’s in the Bay Area. I’ve also lived short-term in many other places. As I mentioned before, I lived in Canada for three months during an exchange program when I was a kid. In college, I lived in Kyoto, Japan, for about three months as part of another exchange. 
 
Last summer, I did an internship in Singapore, where I also traveled around Southeast Asia quite a bit. I went to Indonesia and Malaysia, among other places. I have travel experiences, but those don’t really count as living there.

What would you do if you didn’t have to work? (2 minutes)
Response:  
 
What would I do if I didn’t have to work? That’s a good question. I would probably want to be an artist in many ways. I’d love to create my own novels and draw my own imaginary worlds. I really admire authors who can do world-building, like J.R.R. Tolkien, who created an entire world from his imagination. I want to build my own fantasy world through my writing and drawing.
I want to create a lot of characters and a whole history for that world. I also want to invent magic systems or rules for a world that doesn’t exist in the current reality. So, yeah, I’m thinking either fantasy or sci-fi related novels. I want to write my stories, draw my characters, and paint the scenes.
 
[Part 4. Personal values and closing]
What are your life values? (4 minutes)
Response:  
 
What are my life values? This is really hard to articulate. For me, the most important thing is to explore a lot of interesting things and places. I believe that when you die, you can't take money or material possessions with you; what really matters is the experiences you have as a human being in your life.
 
That’s why, in my 22 years so far, I’ve focused on exploring different places and taking every opportunity to travel, meet new people, and gain new perspectives. I also try out new things from time to time. I really love art, and I enjoy building things—whether it’s interesting technology or projects.
 
I’m thinking about how I can combine these interests to do something positive for society and help others along the way. I believe that’s really important. So, in general, I want to explore a lot of options for myself, and I also want to contribute to society as a responsible citizen. I aim to build tools that can bring positive value and energy to others, using whatever abilities I have.
