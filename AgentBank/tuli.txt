Response:  I attended Sanskriti School in New Delhi from ages 5 to 18, where I developed a solid and consistent friend group. I've always been close to my family, living with my parents, sister, and my dog. My grandparents also lived nearby – family is really important to me. 
 
In high school, I studied physics, chemistry, mathematics, psychology, and English. I was involved in extracurricular activities like Model UN, student council, and debate. From a young age, I've had a passion for hiking, playing basketball and badminton, painting, and cooking. 
 
For college, I moved halfway across the world to Stanford University. I initially started as a psychology major but switched to Symbolic Systems due to a growing interest in computer science, and I'm planning to continue with a co-terminal master's in CS. I’m also interested in education and teaching, and have been section leading for CS classes for a bit. I really enjoy my time here - other than school and spending time with my friends, I play club badminton, volunteer at a dog rescue, and work at On Call Café. 

[Part 2. School life]
What is your major, and what do you study? (2 minutes)
Response:  Symbolic Systems, the intersection of psychology and NLP.
 
Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)
Response: In high school, I had two main groups of friends. The first consisted of people I've known since I was 5 years old. We grew up together, essentially raising each other, and became familiar with each other's families, often spending time in each other's houses. The second group formed during high school, where we connected over a shared sense of humor and common interests. We were all in the same section, which naturally facilitated our meeting and bonding.
 
In college, my primary friend group is composed of international students. We bonded over our similar backgrounds and the shared experience of adapting to life in a foreign country. We spend a lot of our free and work time together, which has deepened our connection. Aside from this group, many of my friendships in college have been more individual-based, formed through living in the same dorms or shared interests, as well as deep similarities in opinions and worldviews. The proximity and time spent together in college settings have significantly allowed these friendships to flourish.

What is your daily life like? (4 minutes)
Response:  I wake up between 7:30 and 8:30 - I will see how long that lasts. I then go to the gym and then my classes. In between classes, I’ll grab a meal with a friend or alone depending on the day. In the evenings, I work with some friends. Other than classes, I watch TV, paint, cook, or hang out with my friends.

What qualities do you value most in other people? (2 minutes)
Response: Honesty, kindness, shared sense of humor, some amount of drive
 
Where have you lived? (2 minutes)
Response:  I have lived in Delhi, then I moved to Gurgaon, a city right outside New Delhi in India. Then I moved to Stanford. 
 
What would you do if you didn’t have to work? (2 minutes)
Response:  I would play with dogs, cook and bake, paint, hang out with my friends and family. I would nap. I would travel and explore cities.
