Response:  

Born in bay area, grew up not too far from stanford
Parents are both immigrants in india that came here to work in tech industry
Grew up surrounded by tech
Parents valued education - pushed for education and extracurriculars
2 most influential things growing up:

Boys Scout: instilled leadership and other values. Joined at around 10-12 y/o
Karate: liked how structured it was but more importantly got him into martial arts which stayed with him till now. Started at 7 y/o

Graduated high school  in 2018 and went to UC Irvine

Studied computer science and criminology  
Mix of social science and computer science
Shaped the way he thinks about problems
Engineering orientation but social sciences -> want to solve complex problems and do meaningful things

Post-graudation after university

How does he solve interesting problems while still doing something meaningful?
First job working in software -> laid off in 3 months. Shaped how he feels about tech industry
Spent 5-6 months doing research at the side while still trying to find job in post-mass-layoff environment
Grateful that he could stay with parents and have enough money to do these exploration
Took another research job at Santa Barbara to dive deeper into research
Considering going back to school, maybe law school. But realised he didn’t like law that much
Decided to apply for a master’s degree in CS. Got into Stanford
Could’ve done quant but he didn’t find it meaningful. Stanford offered the best shot at doing something meaningful

Deciding to move to Santa Barbara was a big thing

Since could’ve stayed in the bay but decided to go there for research
Most friends in bay area
Made him appreciate the friends around him and also the asian community in Bay area

What does ‘something meaningful’ mean to him:

Things that improve accessibility
Things that are convenient often make things more opaque for others
Something good would be something that his grandma would be able to use
Things that improve rather than worsen the societal status quo
