Response:  
Grew up in Iowa. Mom’s side is from Laos and immigrated during the War. Dad’s side is from Iowa. They met there. Mom worked in health care, Dad worked in labor jobs. Two brothers, house-hopped. Spent time at Grandmother’s. Growing up, they shared rooms with their brothers. While young, was able to walk to elementary school. Stayed at the same house and would take the bus to middle school which was a lot further off. Then moved to grandmother’s house sometime around high school when his brother would drive him to school. In middle school and high school, attended a magnet high school. Was in the gifted and talented program. Began to do a lot of math competitions and AP’s because he believed it was the easiest way to go to college for free. Midway through high school, his brother graduated because all the brothers are two years apart. After that, he would drive to school and also work a part-time job at Target to pay for gas and other expenses. During senior year of high school, he applied to Stanford University and Iowa State University as the only two colleges. Applied because a close friend of his, Jimmy, told him about Stanford and its financial-aid packages. Then, covid hit during senior spring of high school all the way up into the first year of college. By then, they had moved out of their Grandma’s into an apartment. He had gone to Stanford during covid in the winter and spring. At Stanford, he joined the Stanford Vietnamese Student association and also created the Lao Student Union. Graduated with a BS in CS with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. During senior year, started working with code-in-place at Stanford. This led to him pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with an Artificial Intelligence Concentration at Stanford.
