[Part 1. Story of your life]
Tell me the story of your life from as early as you remember to today, including all the important choices you’ve made along the way. (8 minutes)
Response:  
I don't have many memories of my childhood. I went to a public school in Hangzhou for primary school, and I guess it was just like an ordinary school life. Then I went to a private middle school in Hangzhou for two years, where I studied for the National Olympiad in Informatics. I had a lot of freedom there because we could skip classes or homework to focus on that. But I was too scared of the high school entrance exam—it felt like a lot of pressure. Then, a new international school was founded in my city, so I transferred there in grade nine.
It was a really small school—about 20 students and 15-ish teachers, so we had very small classes. In my physics class, there were only three students. But the school wasn’t great because many of the students didn’t care about studying. They were just friends with the people who founded the school, or they were the children of those people, and they were all super rich. So, it wasn’t a good learning environment, even though the teachers were nice. I decided to transfer to another school.
I applied to UWC and got into the Costa Rica campus for grades 11 and 12. I spent two years there. The teachers and students were fine, but the school administration was horrible. It was very... exotic in terms of living styles. We had something called "Tico Time," which basically meant if a meeting started at 3, you'd get up from bed at 3 and then go to the meeting. Everything started like 30 minutes late. The weather was nice, but I hadn’t experienced a real winter, so I decided to apply to Carleton College for my undergrad.
Carleton’s in Minnesota, with a real, real winter—horrible winter. But I liked the experience because the professors and students were really nice and caring. Then, I came here to Stanford.

[Part 2. School life]
What is your major, and what do you study? (2 minutes)
Response:  
Um, so, for my undergraduate, I studied mathematics and psychology, with a minor in neuroscience. Um, I really enjoyed learning both. I think psychology allowed me to study the human mind, while mathematics gave me a chance to explore, like, numbers and the structures of very coherent systems, because it’s beyond just numbers—it’s more about the structure of things. And the beauty of it, I just can't describe.
For neuroscience, I think it’s interesting to learn how things work on a biological or physical level. And here at Stanford, I’m doing a master’s in symbolic systems, which I think is about studying the mind and different types of intelligence, whether it’s human intelligence, artificial intelligence in computer science, or even biological systems—like how things evolved to be what they are. Yeah.
 
Who are your friends, and why are they important to you? (4 minutes)
Response:  
The first one is Ruyu. We met during my second year of high school, and we became really close. We discuss a lot of things, like philosophical questions or life in general. We support each other when we're struggling, but mostly it's her supporting me. She's extremely emotionally stable, and yeah, she's really inspiring to me. I remember, like two years ago, I had a mental breakdown, and she was at Cornell at the time. She booked a flight to Minnesota in February, just to visit me for two days. I was really touched by that, and I know we're important to each other. Then there's Alice. She’s also from my high school, in the same year as me. We support each other during emotional breakdowns—we’ve definitely had those together. But yeah, we also play Werewolf together. We have a lot of mutual friends, and we see each other pretty frequently, like during school breaks. We’re planning to see each other this winter. We also have video calls pretty often. I think what I value most in my friends is that we know we love each other unconditionally. I can feel the love, and I think they feel it from me too.
 
What is your daily life like? (4 minutes)
Response:  
I usually wake up around 10 or 11 a.m., then I browse my phone for like an hour and go to class, yeah. After class, it’s usually around 4 or 5 p.m., and I’ll prepare lunch/dinner—like my first meal of the day—while watching TV shows. After dinner, I’ll either do some schoolwork, read some fiction, or watch more TV shows until like 3 a.m., yeah. Or sometimes I go to bed around 2 or 3, yeah.
 
[Part 3. Rapid-fire round]
When was the last time you cried, and why? (2 minutes)
Response:  
I was watching a documentary, and it was about children with dyslexia. In China, there's not much focus on special needs, especially things like dyslexia or other conditions. The kids in the documentary were just starting school, and they faced enormous pressure from their teachers. It was filmed at least five years ago, so there was still a strong emphasis on tests and exams. Their parents and teachers thought they were just stupid or lazy, but in reality, they were struggling with understanding or writing. It wasn’t their fault—they were working really hard.
For me, it was really painful to watch, seeing that they weren’t receiving the resources they deserved. The girl in the documentary really tried hard to study. In fact, those kids put in more effort than the average primary school student. They understood life at such a young age and had to face their problems so early on. I just... yeah, I cried for them.

What qualities do you value most in other people? (2 minutes)
Response:  
Here's a grammar-corrected version of the script while keeping the informal, conversational style: I think the first thing I value is kindness. Because in situations where there's plenty of resources, and people don’t need to compete, everyone has the ability to be nice. But what I really value is when, even in hard situations, where there might be competition, you still care for each other and want the best for other people. I think kindness is about compassion, not just for the people around you but for society too—or even for animals or other issues. I just think being kind is one of the qualities I value the most. And maybe wisdom too, but not as much. I think it’s about being able to take responsibility for what you’ve done, and trying to foresee what your actions might lead to, the different consequences, and embracing them—whatever they are.
 
Where have you lived? (2 minutes)
Response:  
So, I was in Hangzhou, China until, like, grade 10, and then I went to Costa Rica for two years. After that, I was in Minnesota for three years. And now, I’m at Stanford. I’ve done, like, short summer school programs, but I feel like that doesn’t really count as living somewhere. Oh, and I visited North Carolina, yeah.
 
What would you do if you didn’t have to work? (2 minutes)
Response:  
I'd probably do some philanthropy work—not really as a job, but because I really want to contribute to everyone. I see every life as valuable, and I think some people just don't get the resources or attention they need from society, and I wish I could support them in achieving their life’s potential. The area I'm most interested in is education, because I know recently there have been a lot of students dropping out of high school or middle school because of their mental health conditions. I think there should be social support systems, or groups, to help them come back to school or reintegrate into society. As I mentioned before, there are students with different conditions—like dyslexia, ADHD, or more severe conditions like those on the autism spectrum—and I just want to work on systems, either on a broad level or on an individual level, to figure out how I can help them.
 
[Part 4. Personal values and closing]
What are your life values? (4 minutes)
Response:  
For me, the first thing is experience. Like, I think life is about experiencing new things. It’s like, you know when you play games, and you want to explore new places or interact with more NPCs? For me, life is the same—I want to experience new things. I want to see what alternatives are out there. Because when I was just in one place, I could only see life through a certain kind of social construction or expectation. But when I move around and interact with different groups of people, I see there are many different forms of life. So, experience comes first, and then happiness. I think nothing matters more than my happiness, and I really value my mental health. So, yeah. And, oh, maybe kindness too. I value kindness. I want to be a nice person and contribute to society.
