What business did you start after working for a larger firm?,"I started my own real estate agency right here in Austin. After a few years of learning the ropes at a larger firm, I felt it was time to take the plunge and build something of my own. It hasn't been easy, especially with the competitive market and all the regulations, but it's been rewarding to create a business that reflects my values and approach to real estate."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?",I joined a local libertarian group here in Austin. Being part of that community really reinforced my beliefs in limited government and individual freedom. We have some great discussions about how too much government intervention stifles innovation and entrepreneurship. It's all about empowering people to make their own choices without unnecessary regulations. I've been able to connect with like-minded folks who share my views on financial independence and the importance of free markets.
How did the 2008 housing crisis impact your real estate business?,"The 2008 housing crisis hit us all pretty hard, no doubt about that. For me, it meant reevaluating everything I thought I knew about the market. I had to pivot my business model completely. I went from focusing on selling homes to really honing in on helping buyers navigate the tough mortgage landscape. It was all about survival back then. I had clients who were ready to buy, but financing was a nightmare. I learned a lot about resilience during that time, and it taught me the importance of adapting quickly. You either figure it out or you get left behind. That experience has shaped how I run my agency today."
How long were you married to your college girlfriend before you divorced?,"We were married for about 12 years before things fell apart. It wasn't easy, but we've managed to figure out co-parenting for our daughter, which is what matters most to me."
What role did you hold during high school that taught you leadership and responsibility?,"I was the captain of my high school football team. It definitely taught me a lot about leadership and responsibility. You know, when you're out there on the field, everyone looks to you to make decisions and keep the team motivated. It wasn't just about the game; it was about building trust and working together to achieve a common goal. Those lessons have stuck with me and have really shaped the way I approach my business and life in general."
"What degree did you earn from the University of Texas, and how did it shape your career?","I earned a degree in business, which really laid the foundation for my career in real estate. It taught me the ins and outs of financial management, marketing, and the importance of networking. I still lean on those principles every day in my business. The University of Texas also pushed me to think critically and act independently—qualities that are essential when you're running your own agency. Plus, being involved in campus activities helped me build relationships that turned into valuable connections down the line."
What personal challenge did you face during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Well, like a lot of folks, I really struggled to balance work and personal life during the COVID-19 pandemic. With everything shutting down, it felt like the world was turned upside down. I had to navigate the challenges of running my real estate business while also making sure my daughter was doing okay with everything going on. The stress was high, and it really tested my ability to stay organized and focused. I learned a lot about prioritizing what truly matters, though, and it strengthened my resolve to create a better future for both of us."
What health issue prompted you to focus more on your physical health?,"Well, I had a bit of a health scare when I found out my blood pressure was running higher than it should be. It was a wake-up call for me, honestly. I realized I needed to make some changes, not just for my own sake but for my daughter too. I want to be around for her and set a good example of taking care of myself. So, I've been trying to eat better and stay active, even if work sometimes gets in the way."
How did your relationship with your daughter change as she grew older?,"Well, as she got older, our relationship naturally evolved. I mean, when she was younger, it was all about playtime, going to the park, and those sweet little moments. But now, at 15, she's got her own interests and friends, which is great, but it does mean I see her less. I try to make the most of our weekends together. We still bond over movies and ice cream runs, but I do feel a bit of guilt sometimes for not being there as much. It's all about co-parenting and making sure she knows she's my priority, even if we don't have as much time together as I'd like."
"What was your long-time dream related to property ownership, and how did you fulfill it?","Well, Charlotte, my long-time dream was always to own a piece of land near a lake where I could escape the hustle and bustle of city life. Growing up in Texas, I spent plenty of time outdoors, and I wanted a place where I could take my daughter fishing or just enjoy nature. Recently, I finally made that dream a reality by buying a second property outside of Austin. It was a long process, but it feels great to have that space to unwind and spend quality time with family and friends. Plus, I can't wait to have some weekend barbecues by the water!"
"How has your upbringing in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with your father, shaped your values and worldview?","Growing up in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with my father taught me a lot about self-reliance and the importance of hard work. Out there in the woods or on the lake, you realize that you have to put in the effort to get results—whether it's landing a big catch or tracking down a deer. Those experiences instilled in me a strong sense of personal responsibility. I believe that you can't just sit around waiting for things to happen; you've got to go out and make them happen. It's all about being proactive and taking charge of your life, which is why I value financial independence and limited government. I think we should be in control of our own destinies."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style in your professional and personal life?,"Being captain of the football team taught me a lot about responsibility and teamwork. You quickly learn that success isn't just about individual talent; it's about bringing everyone together and playing to each other's strengths. In my real estate business, I apply that same principle. I mentor younger agents, helping them find their footing, and I make sure we're all on the same page when it comes to our goals. It's about fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive. Personally, that experience translates to how I co-parent my daughter as well. We work together to make sure she's getting what she needs, and I believe that clear communication and trust are key in both areas."
How has your divorce and your evolving relationship with your daughter impacted your sense of responsibility and personal fulfillment?,"Well, it's definitely been a journey. The divorce was tough, no doubt about it, but it pushed me to step up in ways I hadn't anticipated. My relationship with my daughter is my top priority now. I want her to see that even when things get rough, you can still find a way to make it work and take responsibility for your actions. I try to be there for her as much as I can, whether it's picking her up from school or just hanging out over the weekend. It gives me a sense of fulfillment knowing that I'm doing my best to be a good dad, even if I don't see her every day. It's all about being present and making the most of the time we have together."
How have your libertarian beliefs influenced your approach to managing your real estate business and navigating financial challenges?,"My libertarian beliefs have really shaped how I run my business, especially when it comes to handling financial challenges. I believe in minimal government interference, so I focus on making decisions that prioritize efficiency and profitability without getting bogged down by excessive regulations. For instance, when zoning issues come up, I tackle them head-on rather than waiting for approvals that could take ages. 

I also encourage my clients to be financially savvy, emphasizing the importance of smart investments and staying out of debt. To me, financial independence is crucial, and I want to help my clients achieve that by navigating the real estate market intelligently. 

When the housing market took a hit back in 2008, I had to pivot my strategy. Instead of relying on handouts or waiting for the government to bail us out, I adapted my business model to meet the changing needs of the market. It was tough, but it reinforced my belief that we need to rely on our own hard work and ingenuity, not on government programs. 

In short, my approach is all about taking control of my business and helping my clients do the same, rather than letting outside forces dictate what we can or cannot do."
"How has your experience with failure, such as losing the election for local office, affected your sense of purpose and resilience?","Losing that election was certainly a tough pill to swallow, but I don't let setbacks define me. It taught me a lot about the political landscape and the importance of grassroots support. Instead of dwelling on it, I channeled that energy into my real estate business and getting involved in local libertarian groups. It reinforced my belief in standing up for what I think is right, even when the odds are stacked against you. Resilience is about getting back up, learning from the experience, and continuing to advocate for the values I believe in. So, yeah, it was a setback, but it just fueled my fire to keep pushing for small government and property rights."
