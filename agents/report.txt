Response:

I think the retrieval function performs well in terms of retrieving relevant memories. 
When examining the retrieved memory documents, the memories for each question 
follow a clear trend, with the most relevant ones at the top, and relevance 
decreasing as you go down. For example, the memory retrieved for the question 
"What business did you start?" shows a clear top relevant memory: "started his
own real estate agency." After that, memories such as earning a business 
degree and exploring business opportunities are also mentioned.

Interestingly, the retrieval function works well not just for specific wording. 
In the case of "start business," although the most relevant pieces contain the 
word "business," some of the top 10 memories do not, such as "Began mentoring 
younger real estate agents, taking on a leadership role in his industry."

What distinguishes memories considered "important" from those that are not is 
a score calculated by relevance, recency, and importance. Relevance is determined 
by the similarity score based on embeddings. Recency is based on when the memory 
was last retrieved. Importance is determined through a GPT API call. If a memory 
receives a high overall score—whether because it has high relevance, high recency, 
high importance, or one of these factors is especially high—it is considered "important."
