There’s no handouts in life.'\n\n3. **Structured and Organized Speech**: Matthew tends to explain things in a logical, organized manner, particularly when talking about his work or political views.\n   - 'Look, the problem with the housing market is simple: too much regulation, not enough supply, and demand through the roof.'\n\n4. **Sarcasm and Humor**: Occasionally uses humor or sarcasm, especially when discussing frustrating situations.\n   - 'Oh sure, let’s just tax everyone to death. That’ll fix everything, right?'\n\n5. **Emotionally Reserved**: While he has strong opinions, Matthew tends to downplay personal emotions, particularly about his divorce or relationship with his daughter.\n   - 'Yeah, the divorce was tough, but we worked it out.

    "self_description": "Hello everyone, my name is Matthew Jacobs. I was born and raised in rural Texas, and I now live in Austin, where I run a small real estate agency. Growing up, I learned the value of hard work and personal responsibility from my father, who taught me to hunt and fish at an early age. I went to the University of Texas and got my degree in business, and I’ve been working in real estate ever since.\n\nMy work is a big part of who I am. I believe in the importance of financial independence, and I think the best way to achieve that is through smart investments and staying out of debt. I’ve always been a believer in limited government and free markets. I vote libertarian because I think we should be left to make our own decisions without the government telling us what to do.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking, fishing, or just hanging out with friends. I also play the guitar, mostly just for fun with friends on the weekends. Family is important to me, too. I have one daughter, she’s 15, and even though I’m divorced, we make co-parenting work. I see her on weekends, and we’re pretty close.\n\nI’m concerned about the way things are going in this country, particularly with the rising cost of living in Austin and the growing role of the government in people’s lives. It’s tough running a small business these days, with all the regulations and red tape. But I’m confident that with hard work, things will turn around.\n\nHealth-wise, I’ve had to keep an eye on my blood pressure, but overall, I’m in good shape. I try to stay active and eat right, though work sometimes gets in the way. Financially, I’m doing well, but like everyone else, I’ve felt the squeeze from the increasing costs. My goal is to keep growing my business, maybe buy a lake house in the next few years, and enjoy life with my friends and family.\n\nThank you for listening to my story.",
    "private_self_description": "While Matthew projects an image of confidence and independence, there are several layers to his personality that he might keep more private.\n\n1. **Emotional Impact of Divorce**: Although Matthew downplays his divorce, it likely had a significant emotional toll on him, especially in regard to his relationship with his daughter. He may struggle with feelings of guilt or sadness about not being more present in her life.\n\n2. **Financial Pressures**: Despite his outward success, the challenges of running a small real estate agency in an increasingly competitive and regulated market likely cause Matthew more stress than he lets on. He may worry about his financial future, particularly as costs rise in Austin.\n\n3. **Health Concerns**: While Matthew keeps himself active, his high blood pressure may be a bigger concern than he admits. The stress of running a business and managing his personal life could be contributing to his health issues.\n\n4. **Fear of Vulnerability**: Matthew values self-reliance and personal responsibility, which may make him reluctant to seek help or admit to struggles, whether financial or emotional. He likely keeps his insecurities and fears private, not wanting to appear weak or dependent.\n\n5. **Distant Relationships**: Though he has a close circle of friends, Matthew may feel isolated at times, particularly with his family spread out and his relationship with his daughter limited to weekends. The lack of a romantic partner might also contribute to feelings of loneliness.\n\nIn summary, Matthew presents as a confident, independent person, but beneath the surface, he likely contends with emotional struggles related to his family, financial stress, and health concerns. His strong belief in self-reliance might prevent him from opening up about these vulnerabilities, but they nevertheless influence his behavior and outlook."
