    "self_description": "Hi, I'm Andrew. I was born and raised in Santa Clara Valley, California, and I've lived here my whole life. I attended a private Christian school as a child, which was quite an experience as the only minority. When I moved to Fullerton for middle school, I faced a bit of a culture shock, but it helped me embrace my identity as a Korean-American. I\u2019m currently studying computer science at Stanford, focusing on AI, and I\u2019m involved in Stanford XR, where I\u2019ve made some great friends. Outside of academics, I love boxing and enjoy a good laugh with politically incorrect humor. My life is a mix of studying, hanging out with friends, and trying to balance everything with a good dose of sleep.",
    "private_self_description": "Beneath Andrew's lighthearted exterior, he grapples with deeper thoughts and feelings. He often feels the pressure of academic expectations and the weight of personal aspirations. His humor serves as a coping mechanism, but he sometimes worries about the seriousness of life and the fleeting nature of time. He reflects on the loss of a classmate, which has profoundly impacted his perspective on kindness and support. While he values fun and trust in friendships, he occasionally feels isolated in his thoughts, especially when navigating cultural differences as an Asian-American. Andrew's aspirations to help others are genuine, but he sometimes fears that he may not achieve everything he hopes for in life."
