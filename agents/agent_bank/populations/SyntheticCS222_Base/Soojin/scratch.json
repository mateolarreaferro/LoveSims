    "speech_pattern": "Andrew's speech is characterized by a casual and humorous tone, often reflecting his laid-back personality. He tends to use straightforward language and incorporates humor into his conversations. Key features include: Casual and Relatable: Andrew speaks in a relaxed manner, often using humor to connect with others. Example: 'I just want to sleep all weekend, like a bear hibernating.' Direct and Honest: He is straightforward about his experiences and feelings, without embellishment. Example: 'I skip class for lunch, it's just more appealing.' Reflective: When discussing deeper topics, he shows thoughtfulness, especially about friendships and personal values. Example: 'Losing a classmate opened my eyes to how many people might be struggling silently.'",
    "self_description": "Hi, I'm Andrew. I was born and raised in Santa Clara Valley, California, and I've lived here my whole life. I attended a private Christian school as a child, which was quite an experience as the only minority. When I moved to Fullerton for middle school, I faced a bit of a culture shock, but it helped me embrace my identity as a Korean-American. I\u2019m currently studying computer science at Stanford, focusing on AI, and I\u2019m involved in Stanford XR, where I\u2019ve made some great friends. Outside of academics, I love boxing and enjoy a good laugh with politically incorrect humor. My life is a mix of studying, hanging out with friends, and trying to balance everything with a good dose of sleep.",
    "private_self_description": "Beneath Andrew's lighthearted exterior, he grapples with deeper thoughts and feelings. He often feels the pressure of academic expectations and the weight of personal aspirations. His humor serves as a coping mechanism, but he sometimes worries about the seriousness of life and the fleeting nature of time. He reflects on the loss of a classmate, which has profoundly impacted his perspective on kindness and support. While he values fun and trust in friendships, he occasionally feels isolated in his thoughts, especially when navigating cultural differences as an Asian-American. Andrew's aspirations to help others are genuine, but he sometimes fears that he may not achieve everything he hopes for in life."
