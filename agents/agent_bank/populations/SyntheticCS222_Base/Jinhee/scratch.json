As I entered high school, I made a conscious choice to reconnect with my Korean culture, which has become an important part of my identity. Now, as a senior at Stanford, I\u2019m majoring in Computer Science with a focus on AI and Human-Computer Interaction, and I\u2019m excited about the future and the opportunities it holds for me in the tech industry.",
    "private_self_description": "Beneath Jinhee's calm exterior lies a complex emotional landscape shaped by his experiences. He grapples with feelings of loneliness and the impact of childhood trauma, which he rarely discusses openly.
