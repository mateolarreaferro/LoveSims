What business did you start after working for a larger firm?,"I started my own real estate agency here in Austin. After a few years of working under a larger firm, I realized I wanted more control over my business and the way I serve my clients. It wasn't easy at first, especially with the competition in the market, but I knew I could provide a more personal touch and focus on what really matters to my clients. I took the leap, and it's been a rewarding journey ever since."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?","I joined a local libertarian group. Being part of that community really reinforced my beliefs in limited government and personal responsibility. We often discuss how government overreach affects our daily lives and the economy. It's been eye-opening to connect with others who share the same values, especially when it comes to advocating for more freedom in our financial choices and less interference in our personal lives."
How did the 2008 housing crisis impact your real estate business?,"The 2008 housing crisis was a real wake-up call for me and a lot of folks in the industry. I was working under a larger firm at the time, and we saw deals fall through left and right. It was tough. I had to pivot my business model to adapt to the changing market. I focused on building trust with my clients, emphasizing transparency, and educating them on the financial aspects of buying and selling homes. It wasn't easy, but I learned that if you want to survive in this business, you have to be resilient and willing to change. That experience ultimately led me to start my own agency in Austin, where I could have more control over how I operate."
How long were you married to your college girlfriend before you divorced?,"We were married for about 12 years. It wasn't an easy decision to divorce, but sometimes life takes unexpected turns. We both realized it was best for us and our daughter to part ways, and we've made co-parenting work since then."
What role did you hold during high school that taught you leadership and responsibility?,"Well, I was the captain of my high school football team. That role really taught me a lot about leadership and responsibility. You learn quickly that being a captain isn't just about calling the plays on the field; it's about motivating your teammates, holding them accountable, and leading by example. It gave me a solid foundation for the kind of leadership I practice in my business today."
"What degree did you earn from the University of Texas, and how did it shape your career?","I earned a degree in business, which really laid the foundation for everything I do today. The coursework taught me about finance, marketing, and management, but more importantly, it instilled a sense of discipline and responsibility. I learned how to analyze markets and understand what drives consumer behavior, which has been crucial in my real estate career. That education, combined with the real-world experience I gained working under a larger firm, really shaped my approach to running my own agency now. I believe that the skills I developed there are key to navigating the challenges of the real estate market, especially in a competitive place like Austin."
What personal challenge did you face during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Well, like many folks, I really struggled with balancing work and personal life during the pandemic. The real estate market took a hit, and I found myself stressed out trying to keep my business afloat while also being there for my daughter. It was a tough juggling act. I had to adapt quickly to virtual showings and all the new regulations, which added more pressure. It was a challenging time, but I learned a lot about resilience and the importance of having a solid support system."
What health issue prompted you to focus more on your physical health?,"Well, I had a bit of a health scare related to high blood pressure a while back. It really opened my eyes to how important it is to take care of myself, especially with the stress from work and everything else going on in life. I realized that if I want to keep running my business and being there for my daughter, I need to prioritize my health. So, I've been trying to stay active, eat better, and manage my stress a little more effectively."
How did your relationship with your daughter change as she grew older?,"Well, as she's grown up, I've definitely noticed some changes. When she was little, it was all about playtime and just having fun together. Now that she's 15, she's got her own interests, her own friends, and sometimes I feel like I'm competing with all that for her attention. It can be tough, but I try to stay involved in her life by being supportive of whatever she's passionate about. We still have our weekends together, and I cherish that time, whether we're just hanging out or doing something special. I mean, it's all about finding that balance, right? I want her to know I'm there for her, even if it's not as much as it used to be."
"What was your long-time dream related to property ownership, and how did you fulfill it?","Well, my long-time dream was always to own a piece of land near a lake where I could relax and enjoy the outdoors. Growing up in Texas, I spent a lot of time fishing and hiking, so having my own spot to unwind and maybe even teach my daughter some of those skills was really important to me. Recently, I finally made that dream a reality by buying a second property outside of Austin. It's been a lot of work, but I can't wait to spend weekends there, surrounded by nature and making memories with family and friends."
"How has your upbringing in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with your father, shaped your values and worldview?","Growing up in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with my father instilled in me a strong sense of self-reliance and responsibility. Those experiences taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. When you're out there in nature, whether you're waiting for a fish to bite or tracking game, you learn patience and the importance of planning ahead. It's the same in business and life; you have to put in the effort to see the results. I also learned to appreciate the outdoors, which keeps me grounded and reminds me of the simpler things in life. Those lessons shaped my belief in financial independence and limited government. I think everyone should have the freedom to make their own choices, just like I had the freedom to choose my path growing up."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style in your professional and personal life?,"Being captain of the football team taught me a lot about responsibility and teamwork. I learned that you can't just bark orders and expect people to follow; you have to earn their trust and respect. In my real estate agency, I carry that over by mentoring younger agents and creating a supportive environment. I believe in leading by example, whether that's through hard work or showing up for my clients and team. Plus, the pressure of being a captain helped me stay calm in stressful situations—a skill that's invaluable in real estate, especially when the market gets tough. Overall, it shaped my approach to both business and family, reminding me that good leadership is about lifting others up and working together toward a common goal."
How has your divorce and your evolving relationship with your daughter impacted your sense of responsibility and personal fulfillment?,"Well, Charlotte, going through the divorce was certainly a challenge. It forced me to really step up and take responsibility for my daughter in a different way. I've learned that co-parenting is all about putting her first, and that's been a real wake-up call for me. It's not always easy, but I try to make the most of the time I have with her on the weekends. 

I find a lot of personal fulfillment in being there for her—whether it's picking her up from school or just hanging out and grabbing ice cream. It reminds me that despite the ups and downs, family is what truly matters. I want her to see me as a solid figure in her life, and that drives me to keep improving myself, both as a father and as a person. 

So, while the divorce was tough, it actually reignited my sense of responsibility and purpose. I may not be a perfect dad, but I'm doing my best to make sure she knows she's loved and supported."
How have your libertarian beliefs influenced your approach to managing your real estate business and navigating financial challenges?,"My libertarian beliefs have really shaped how I run my business and deal with the financial ups and downs. I'm all about minimizing government interference, which means I focus on keeping my operations lean and efficient. I make it a point to stay informed about local regulations and zoning laws, and I advocate for reducing red tape because I believe that's what allows small businesses to thrive. 

When financial challenges hit, like during the 2008 crisis or the current rising costs in Austin, I rely on my principles of personal responsibility and smart investment. I avoid debt as much as possible, and I encourage my clients to think the same way. I also mentor young agents in my agency, sharing that philosophy so they can navigate the market effectively without getting bogged down by unnecessary regulations. It's about empowering people to make their own choices and recognizing that we're often better off without government hand-holding."
"How has your experience with failure, such as losing the election for local office, affected your sense of purpose and resilience?","Losing that election was definitely a tough pill to swallow. I put my heart and soul into the campaign because I truly believe in the principles of small government and property rights. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson about resilience. Failure is part of life, and it's how you respond to it that really counts. I didn't let it derail my purpose; instead, it fueled my passion even more. I realized that even if I didn't win that battle, I could still make a difference through my business and by staying active in the community. It's all about bouncing back and continuing to fight for what you believe in. So, I joined the local libertarian group afterward, and that's been a great way to stay involved and connect with like-minded folks. Every setback is just a setup for a comeback, right?"
