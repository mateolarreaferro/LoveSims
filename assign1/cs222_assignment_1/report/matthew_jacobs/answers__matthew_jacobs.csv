Question,Agent's Response
What business did you start after working for a larger firm?,"After working for a larger firm for a few years, I decided to take the plunge and start my own real estate agency right here in Austin. It was a big step, but I felt it was the best way to truly serve my clients and have more control over the business. I wanted to create a more personalized experience for buyers and sellers something that I felt was lacking in the bigger firms. Plus, I really believed in the power of hard work and building relationships, which are the cornerstones of my agency's success. It's been a challenging journey, especially with the competitive market, but I'm proud of what I've built."
"What political group did you join, and what beliefs did you strengthen through this association?","I joined a local libertarian group, and through that association, I really strengthened my beliefs in limited government and personal financial independence. It was a great way to connect with like-minded individuals who share the same values. We often discuss how reducing government intervention can lead to a thriving economy and more opportunities for small businesses like mine. It aligns perfectly with my conviction that we should be free to make our own choices without unnecessary regulations holding us back."
How did the 2008 housing crisis impact your real estate business?,"The 2008 housing crisis was a real wake-up call for me and my business. I faced some significant financial difficulties; it was like the ground fell out from under us. I had to pivot my business model pretty quickly. Instead of focusing solely on selling homes, I started looking into rental properties and property management to diversify my income. It wasn't easy, but I learned a lot about adapting to market changes. I also had to get a lot more proactive in networking and building relationships attending conferences became crucial for staying informed about market trends. It really taught me that in real estate, you've got to be resilient and ready to change your strategy on a dime. Hard work and persistence paid off in the end, and I'm proud to say that I managed to keep my agency afloat through those tough times."
How long were you married to your college girlfriend before you divorced?,"I was married to my college girlfriend for 12 years before we divorced. It was a challenging time, but we figured out how to co-parent our daughter effectively. At the end of the day, it's all about what's best for her."
What role did you hold during high school that taught you leadership and responsibility?,"I was the captain of my high school football team. That role really taught me a lot about leadership and responsibility. I had to make sure my teammates were motivated and working together, not to mention leading by example both on and off the field. It was a tough job, but it instilled in me the value of hard work and commitment, which has carried over into my adult life, especially in running my real estate agency."
"What degree did you earn from the University of Texas, and how did it shape your career?","I earned a degree in business from the University of Texas. That degree was really the foundation of my career. It taught me not just the ins and outs of business principles but also how to think critically and strategically. I learned about finance, marketing, and management, which have all been crucial in running my real estate agency. It gave me the confidence to take the leap into entrepreneurship after working a few years under a larger firm. Without that education, I don't think I would've had the same understanding of the market dynamics that I deal with every day. It really shaped my approach to investments and helped me understand the importance of financial independence."
What personal challenge did you face during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really struggled with balancing my work and personal life. As a small business owner, the uncertainty was tough. I found myself working longer hours, trying to keep my real estate agency afloat while also managing the stress of everything going on. It was a real wake-up call for me, and I had to focus hard on my mental health. I realized that I needed to take a step back and prioritize my well-being, especially since I had to be there for my daughter. It wasn't easy, but I learned the importance of finding that balance and making time for what truly matters."
What health issue prompted you to focus more on your physical health?,"Well, I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a while back. It was higher than it should be, and it really made me realize that I needed to take my health more seriously. I mean, I've always been active, but sometimes work gets in the way, you know? So, I started focusing on eating better and staying active. It was a wake-up call that pushed me to make some changes."
How did your relationship with your daughter change as she grew older?,"As my daughter has grown older, our relationship has definitely evolved. When she was younger, I was her go-to for everything whether it was playing outside or helping with homework. But now that she's a teenager, I find that we don't spend as much time together as I'd like. She has her own interests and friends, which is normal, but it does make me feel like I'm missing out sometimes. I've had to adjust my expectations and remind myself that it's all part of her growing up. We still have our weekends together, and I try to make those moments count. Whether it's grabbing ice cream after school or just hanging out, I cherish those times. It's a balancing act, but we're making it work, and that's what matters most."
"What was your long-time dream related to property ownership, and how did you fulfill it?","You know, my long-time dream was always to own some land near a lake. Growing up in rural Texas, I spent countless weekends fishing and camping, and I always wanted a place where I could escape the hustle and bustle of city life. A few years back, I finally made that dream a reality when I bought a second property just outside of Austin. It wasn't easy, but with careful planning and some smart investments, I was able to find the perfect spot. Now, I can spend my weekends there, enjoying the outdoors with my daughter and friends, and it's a great retreat from my busy work life. It really solidified my belief in financial independence and the importance of pursuing your dreams."

"How has your upbringing in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with your father, shaped your values and worldview?","Growing up in rural Texas, learning to hunt and fish with my father, really instilled in me the values of hard work and self-sufficiency. When you're out there in the woods or on the lake, it's just you and the environment, and you quickly learn that if you want to catch something, you have to put in the effort. It taught me that nothing worth having comes easy. Those experiences shaped my belief in personal responsibility and the idea that we should rely on ourselves to get things done, rather than looking for help from the government or anyone else. 

This mindset carries over into my work in real estate. I believe in making smart investments and staying out of debt principles that were reinforced by those early lessons in the great outdoors. Plus, being part of a community where everyone had to work hard to make a living really deepened my appreciation for limited government and free markets. It's about letting people make their own choices and carve out their paths without unnecessary interference. 

So, every time I go fishing or hiking, I'm reminded of those early lessons. They remind me that the best things in life come from hard work and determination, and that's a philosophy I carry with me every day."
In what ways did your experience as captain of your high school football team influence your leadership style in your professional and personal life?,"Being captain of my high school football team was a pivotal experience for me. It taught me the importance of responsibility and teamwork, which I carry into my professional life every day. I learned how to motivate others and lead by example, whether it's mentoring younger real estate agents or working with clients. You can't just bark orders; you have to earn respect and trust. 

In that role, I also had to make tough decisions under pressure, which translates directly into running my real estate agency. When the market gets tough, I rely on that experience to stay calm and focused, guiding my team through challenges. Plus, it reinforced my belief in the value of hard work. You don't win games without putting in the effort, and the same goes for growing a business. 

Overall, I think those early lessons in leadership have shaped my pragmatic approach to both work and life. It's about finding solutions and supporting those around you, just like we did on the field."
How has your divorce and your evolving relationship with your daughter impacted your sense of responsibility and personal fulfillment?,"Well, the divorce definitely shook me up a bit, but it also made me step up in ways I didn't expect. Co-parenting with my ex has taught me a lot about responsibility. I want to be there for my daughter, especially as she navigates her teenage years. It's about making sure she knows I'm always in her corner, no matter what. 

As for personal fulfillment, I'd say it's a work in progress. I find a lot of satisfaction in my work and mentoring younger agents, helping them grow in this tough market. But I also feel that sense of fulfillment when I spend time with my daughter. We have our weekends together, and those moments are what really matter. 

I guess my experiences have made me more resilient and focused. If anything, they've reinforced my belief in hard work and making the most of what I have whether that's time with family or opportunities in my business. Life throws challenges at you, but it's how you respond that defines your sense of responsibility and fulfillment."
How have your libertarian beliefs influenced your approach to managing your real estate business and navigating financial challenges?,"My libertarian beliefs play a massive role in how I manage my real estate business and tackle financial challenges. First off, I firmly believe in keeping government out of our lives. That means I advocate for less regulation in the housing market. Too many rules just stifle innovation and make it harder for small businesses like mine to thrive. I've seen firsthand how overwhelming regulations can limit opportunities, especially when I was trying to expand my agency a few years back. 

When it comes to financial challenges, my focus is on smart investments and maintaining a lean operation. I encourage my clients to think for themselves and make informed decisions. Just like I believe in financial independence, I also promote it to my clients. If I see someone struggling with debt, I'll be upfront about the importance of living within their means. 

Honestly, I think the best way to navigate tough times is to be proactive and take control of your financial future. I've had my share of ups and downs, especially during the 2008 housing crisis, which forced me to rethink my business model. I learned that if you want something done right, you have to take care of it yourself no handouts, just hard work. And that's exactly how I approach both my business and my personal life. 

So, whether I'm mentoring younger agents or dealing with clients, I always emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and making choices that align with financial independence. It's all about empowering people to take charge of their own lives."
"How has your experience with failure, such as losing the election for local office, affected your sense of purpose and resilience?","Losing that election was certainly a tough pill to swallow. I went in with a clear vision for advocating for property rights and limited government, but it just didn't pan out. However, I've always believed that failure is just a stepping stone to success. It taught me resilience. I realized that just because one door closes, it doesn't mean the opportunity is gone. I took that experience and channeled it into my real estate business and my involvement in the local libertarian group. It reinforced my commitment to my values and the importance of standing up for what I believe in, even when the odds are against me. Now, I focus on making a difference through my business and community involvement, and I'm more determined than ever to push for the changes I believe in."
