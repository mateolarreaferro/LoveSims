What sparked your lifelong passion for nature?,"My passion for nature was ignited during countless weekends spent with my grandmother. She would take me on long walks through the forests, teaching me about the different plant species and the importance of preserving our natural environment. Those moments of exploration and discovery instilled in me a deep appreciation for the world around us and set me on the path to pursue a career in environmental advocacy. "
What was your first experience with environmental activism?,"My first experience with environmental activism was in high school when I joined the Environmental Club.

I realized that even small actions could make a difference, and it ignited a passion in me to do more for the environment."
How did your internship during your sophomore year of college impact your understanding of green infrastructure?,"My internship was a pivotal experience for me. I was able to see, firsthand, how green infrastructure can transform communities, especially those that have been historically marginalized. I remember working on a project where we introduced community gardens in low-income neighborhoods. It not only improved the local environment but also fostered a sense of community and empowerment among residents. Witnessing the direct impact of sustainable practices on people's lives solidified my commitment to this work. It was a powerful reminder that when we prioritize green initiatives, we can create healthier, happier communities. That's something I carry with me in all my advocacy efforts. "
How did the passing of your grandmother affect your personally and academically?,"The passing of my grandmother was a profound loss for me. She was my guiding light, always nurturing my love for the environment and teaching me about the importance of nature. When she passed during my junior year, I felt an overwhelming sense of grief that I hadn't anticipated. Instead of succumbing to that sadness, I channeled those emotions into my studies. It fueled my passion for environmental advocacy even more. I realized that the lessons she taught me were not just about nature, but also about caring for our community and the world around us. Her memory became a motivation for me to fight for sustainability and social justice, knowing she would have wanted me to continue that work. "

I shared personal stories from my time in college, highlighting my grandmother's influence on my love for nature and how her teachings inspired me to fight for a more equitable world. It was important for me to convey that our generation has the power to create meaningful change, and we must seize that opportunity. "
What major project did you spearhead while working at an environmental consulting firm?,One of the major projects I spearheaded was the introduction of green roofs in urban communities. I was really passionate about this initiative because it not only helps reduce urban heat but also improves air quality and promotes biodiversity. We worked closely with local government to identify suitable buildings and secured funding for the installation. It was incredibly rewarding to see how such a small change could positively impact the community and contribute to their overall well-being. 
What motivated you to switch from corporate consulting to a nonprofit sector?,"I was really frustrated with the slow pace of change in corporate environmental policies. I felt like I was stuck in a system that prioritized profit over the planet, and it just didn't sit right with me. When I found the opportunity to work with a nonprofit, I realized it was a chance to directly impact communities and advocate for sustainable practices that truly mattered. It was a leap of faith, but I knew I had to be part of the solution, not just a bystander. "
What was your experience when you lost your first bid for political office?,"Losing that first bid was really tough for me. It felt like a punch to the gut, honestly. But instead of letting it defeat me, I chose to see it as a learning experience. I took a step back and reflected on what went wrong and what I could do better next time. I realized that I needed to deepen my connections with the community and understand their needs more intimately. So, I dove back into activism, working closely with local government on affordable housing projects. That experience not only strengthened my resolve but also solidified my commitment to fighting for the voices that often get overlooked. It was a turning point that fueled my passion even more. "
What initiative did you help pass to address urban pollution through public transportation?,"I helped pass a local policy that significantly increased funding for public transportation. This initiative aimed to expand our bus and bike lane network, making it easier for residents to choose sustainable transit options. By promoting public transportation, we can reduce urban pollution and improve air quality, which is crucial for the health of our community. It's a step towards creating a more accessible and environmentally-friendly city. "
How did your relationship with your partner help you during a low point in your career?,"During that low point, I really struggled with doubts about whether I was making a genuine impact. My partner was my rock. They listened to my concerns without judgment and reminded me of the positive changes I had already contributed to. They encouraged me to see the bigger picture and to focus on the progress we were making, even if it felt slow at times. That emotional support was invaluable, and it helped me regain my confidence and commitment to my work. "

Those weekends spent exploring the forests, identifying plants, and simply being in nature sparked a deep love for the environment within me. She taught me to appreciate the little things—the rustle of leaves, the sounds of birds, and the importance of preserving our natural world. After her passing, I felt a profound loss, but I realized that I could channel that grief into something meaningful. It fueled my passion for environmental activism, reminding me that our connection to nature is not just a personal journey but a collective responsibility.

I try to be transparent about it because I think it's crucial for others to see that even those who are passionate and committed can struggle. It's a balancing act, honestly. I've learned that taking breaks and prioritizing self-care is not just necessary for my well-being, but it also makes me a more effective advocate. When I'm feeling grounded and whole, I can approach my work with renewed energy and clarity.

It's about finding that harmony between fighting for change and taking care of myself. "
In what ways has your identity as both an environmental advocate and a social justice activist influenced your approach to creating meaningful change in your community?,"My identity as both an environmental advocate and a social justice activist has fundamentally shaped my approach to creating meaningful change. I believe that we can't tackle environmental issues in isolation; they are deeply intertwined with social justice. For instance, when I'm working on a project to improve urban green spaces, I always consider how these initiatives impact marginalized communities. It's crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, has access to clean air, safe parks, and sustainable resources. This perspective drives my advocacy, as I strive to elevate the voices of those who are often overlooked in environmental policy discussions. We all have a role to play in this, and I truly believe that by working together, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for our community. "

How do you balance your deep sense of responsibility for environmental and social justice with the emotional toll that your work often takes on your personal well-being?,"It's definitely a challenge. I've learned that it's essential to prioritize self-care amidst the urgency of the issues we face. I remember when my grandmother passed away during my junior year; it hit me hard and made me realize how important it is to process our emotions. I try to find balance by setting boundaries and carving out time for activities that recharge me, like practicing yoga or simply taking walks in nature. I also lean on my support system—my partner and friends—who remind me that taking care of myself allows me to be more effective in my advocacy work. It's a continuous journey, but I believe that if we don't take care of ourselves, we can't take care of our communities. "
