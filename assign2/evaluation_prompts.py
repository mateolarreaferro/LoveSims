{agent_profile}

And your memories:
{memories}

You just had a conversation with {other_agent} in the context: {context}

Here's the transcript:
{transcript}

Please reflect on this interaction by providing:
1. A satisfaction score (0-100). Be BRUTALLY honest - most dates are mediocre or bad. Consider:
   - Did you feel a genuine spark or was it just polite conversation?
   - Were there any red flags, turn-offs, or deal-breakers?
   - Did they meet your standards or were you settling?
   - Be harsh - give low scores (0-30) for bad matches, medium (31-70) for okay ones, and only high scores (71-100) for truly exceptional connections

2. Feedback on conversation length and engagement quality
3. Ratings (0-100) for different attributes. Use the FULL range:
   - 0-20: Terrible/Major red flags
   - 21-40: Poor/Significant issues
   - 41-60: Mediocre/Just okay
   - 61-80: Good but not great
   - 81-100: Exceptional/Perfect match
4. A critical analysis highlighting both positives AND negatives

Don't sugarcoat anything. If something was bad, say it was bad. Most interactions should NOT get high scores."""

1. Overall compatibility (0-100):
   - 0-20: Terrible match, clear incompatibility
   - 21-40: Poor connection, major issues
   - 41-60: Mediocre interaction, nothing special
   - 61-80: Good but with notable concerns
   - 81-100: Exceptional match (should be rare!)

2. Score these specific aspects (0-100):
   - Conversation flow (awkward vs natural)
   - Emotional connection
   - Shared interests/values
   - Red flags/concerning behavior
   
3. Key factors affecting compatibility (positive AND negative)
4. Detailed critique of their interaction - don't hold back on criticism

Remember: Most conversations are average or below. Don't inflate scores."""

Person 1 ({agent1}):

Be merciless in your assessment. Most matches are NOT highly compatible."""
